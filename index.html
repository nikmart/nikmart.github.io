      <section>
        <p>Hi, I'm Nik. I am an Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon's Human-Computer Interaction Institute. My research seeks to augment designers' capabilities so that we can best leverage human capacity and computation to solve society's toughest problems. My research approach integrates cutting-edge technologies, but always with a foundational understanding of designers and how we think and act. This research activity informs my educational mission to teach future designers how to work creatively and critically so they can solve complex, open-ended design challenges. My work spans design domains, blending hardware, software, and interaction design. Before moving to the HCII, I was a researcher in the <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/accenture-labs/digitalexperiences" target="_blank"> Digital Experiences group at the Accenture Technology Labs</a>. I graduated with my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford's Center for Design Research, where I was co-advised by <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/larry-leifer" target="_blank">Larry Leifer</a> and <a href="http://www.wendyju.com" target="_blank">Wendy Ju.</a> I graduated with my B.S. in Engineering Design from the <a href="https://www.olin.edu" target="_blank">Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering</a>.</p>

        <h3>Prospective Students</h3>
        <p>Students interested in the <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/academics/phd-hci" target="_blank">HCII Ph.D.</a> program should apply during the next cycle in autumn. The HCII admits students at the department level. Students are then matched with faculty advisors in their first weeks on campus. If you are interested in joining my group, you are welcome to mention me in your application. I also recommend that you look into <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/faculty" target="_blank">other faculty</a> you might be interested in working with and mention them in your application. Consider why you would like to work with these faculty, what you think you can bring to their group, and what you think they could bring to your research.</p>

        <p>Student interested in the <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/academics/masters-programs">Masters in Human-Computer Interaction (MHCI)</a> should direct their questions to the program director. Please note that our Masters program is a 1-year professional degree that prepares students for industry and is not a research-oriented program. This being said, MHCI students are welcome to join my research group for Independent Studies.</p>

        <h3>CMU Students</h3>
        <p>If you are a CMU student interested in working on one of my group's research projects, please check the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AtmjGPa0gTOezwukgJiRWcvzQXZYL1lueRqrE5ayWcQ/edit?gid=1632610366#gid=1632610366" target="_blank">HCII Independent Study</a> list for open positions and the desired skills. My group posts new positions at the start of each semester.</p>

        <p>If you are a student entrepreneur interested in feedback or advising for your venture, you are welcome to reach out to me via email.</p>
